Basic Q-learning by hand

This program tries to use reinforcement learning to learn how to traverse a network path. 



The initial possible paths are provided. We
1. Create the R-matrix
2. Create the blank Q-matrix
3. Run epochs/episodes to update the Q-matrix based on what the agents discover.

At the end we test the validity of the Q-matrix by running one (trivial) use case.
